### Structure

The directory contains web sub directories and a sub directory for hosting model and other scripts:

1. [main.py](https://github.com/abhishek-parashar/Binge-Watcher/blob/master/main.py)The file which contains all the main backend operations of the website and used to run the flask server locally.
   
2. [Procfile](https://github.com/abhishek-parashar/Binge-Watcher/blob/master/Procfile) for setting up heroku.

3. [requirement.txt](https://github.com/abhishek-parashar/Binge-Watcher/blob/master/requirements.txt) contains all the dependencies.

4. [templates](https://github.com/abhishek-parashar/Binge-Watcher/tree/master/templates) contains the html file.

5. [static](https://github.com/abhishek-parashar/Binge-Watcher/tree/master/static) contains the css file.
  
### Codebase

The entire code has been developed using Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript programming languages and is hosted on Heroku. The analysis and model is developed using SkcitLearn library and various machine learning models, The website is developed using Flask. 

### How to run the project:

  1. Open the `Terminal`.
  2. Clone the repository by entering `https://github.com/abhishek-parashar/Binge-Watcher`.
  3. Ensure that `Python3` and `pip` are installed on the system.
  4. Create a `virtualenv` by executing the following command: `virtualenv venv`.
  5. Activate the `venv` virtual environment by executing the follwing command: `source venv/bin/activate`.
  6. Enter the cloned repository directory and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  7. Now, execute the following command: `flask run` and it will point to the `localhost` server with the port `5000`.
  8. Enter the `IP Address: http://localhost:5000` on a web browser and use the application.

### I tried many models for sentiment analysis I got the best results with Multinomial Naive Bayes.
### Recommendation System developed using Cosine similarity (Collaborative Filtering)
